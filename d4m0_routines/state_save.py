Class is going to be instantiated for each ship in order to provide access to
a bit of the history, their current mission status, and to provide useful
methods such as one to determine whether or not the ship has been in transit
to its destination for too long, being as my original (static method based)
algorithm wasn't working anyway.

        It occurs to me while deciding that this bit of work needs to be
        handled in its own method that, perhaps, it would be a good idea to
        create a wrapper class for the individual ships.  I don't know how
        much of a performance penalty there might be for such, but if it's
        not too bad, it'd be a lot easier serializing the objects, or
        portions thereof, if it were laid out this way, and would probably
        save some confusion when looking at parallel structures for ship
        related data.
