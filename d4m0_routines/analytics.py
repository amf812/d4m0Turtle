    Current algorithm idea:
    as noted in issue #2 on the github repo, I think that an expanding
    perimeter check will be the most efficient way to handle this, for now.
    We'll go out in expanding 1-cell thickness squares from the point of
    origin, stopping when a halite deposit within 20% of max is found, when
    the maximal distance from the origin is found, or reasonable defaults.

    Original Plan:
    if there isn't maximal halite on this very spot, this routine will
    locate at least 3 of the closest halite resources, with at least one being
    a maximal halite deposit (more than 3, until maximal deposit is located,
    perhaps up to a certain limit

    Args:
        current_ship: data for the current ship being processed
        current_map: the map's data after the most recent update
        max_distance: integer signifying how far from location to search
