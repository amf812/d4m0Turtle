        Current algorithm idea:
        as noted in issue #2 on the github repo, I think that an expanding
        perimeter check will be the most efficient way to handle this, for now.
        We'll go out in expanding 1-cell thickness squares from the point of
        origin, stopping when a halite deposit within 20% of max is found, when
        the maximal distance from the origin is found, or reasonable defaults.

        Original Plan:
        if there isn't maximal halite on this very spot, this routine will
        locate at least 3 of the closest halite resources, with at least one being
        a maximal halite deposit (more than 3, until maximal deposit is located,
        perhaps up to a certain limit

        Args:
            current_ship: data for the current ship being processed
            current_map: the map's data after the most recent update
            max_distance: integer signifying how far from location to search

            relative_halite_positions: array of dicts, w/'position' & 'quantity'
