        This will just save the ship's particular state, at least for a
        certain number of turns before updating.

        It occurs to me while deciding that this bit of work needs to be
        handled in its own method that, perhaps, it would be a good idea to
        create a wrapper class for the individual ships.  I don't know how
        much of a performance penalty there might be for such, but if it's
        not too bad, it'd be a lot easier serializing the objects, or
        portions thereof, if it were laid out this way, and would probably
        save some confusion when looking at parallel structures for ship
        related data.
