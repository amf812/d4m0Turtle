Started on: 19oct18 (or well that's when I remembered at add this note,
anyway)

Just my first attempt at getting a bot going decently in the Halite III AI
coding competition; still have 2.75 months left to go on it right now.  So
I guess the estimated final version has to be in right around the middle of
January.  Good project to keep me busy in winter, and to get my skills up to
the best level they can be (at least in py3).
